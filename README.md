Hello, this API is the backend to the Mini Capstone application, an application that was created as the final app leading up to the capstone project.

The application is a fully functioning CRUD app that functions much like the Amazon website does. It has index, create, show, update, and delete functions for products, orders, and suppliers. It also has more complex relations and additional data tables, as well as JWT authentication on session create and login.

It also utilizes serializers, has_many belongs_to relations, cors configuration, and a fully working frontend as well.

This application was a solo project made 100% from scratch by Matthew Katz.
